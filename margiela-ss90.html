    <p>Revisit the groundbreaking Spring/Summer 1990 show held on October 19, a pivotal moment that propelled Belgian designer Martin Margiela into the forefront of international fashion. This event marked a radical departure from the established norms of the 1980s fashion system. Margiela challenged the notions of exclusivity and self-referentiality, introducing a new paradigm centered on provocation and dismantling the status quo. Embracing the concept of the "real," Margiela sought to deconstruct the simulated perfection prevalent in fashion shows of the time.</p>

    <p>Breaking away from the conventional Paris Fashion Week venues, Margiela chose a dilapidated marquee in the challenging Parisian suburbs. Demonstrating a commitment to community engagement, he enlisted the help of local boys to find a suitable location. The unconventional approach extended to involving a neighborhood elementary school in an art and creativity project, with the students creating over 500 unique, handmade invitations. The show's front row was reserved for local children, a gesture of gratitude from Margiela for their contribution. Models, alongside these local kids, navigated a bumpy "non-runway," creating a memorable and slightly chaotic spectacle that defied the traditional fashion show experience.</p>
